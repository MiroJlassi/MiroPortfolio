      <h2>Escape Circles</h2>
      <p>Escape Circles is my 1<sup>st</sup> Android game, i had so much fun working on this project.
        It was a challenge suggested by a friend during 2019 quarantine to develop
        and release a game within one week...
        <br>
        Escape Circles reached Top 1 "most downloaded arcade game"
        for the 1<sup>st</sup> 24hr.
