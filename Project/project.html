        <h2>ESCAPE CIRCLES</h2>
        <p>Escape Circles is my 1<sup>st</sup> Android game,made with Unity game engine and C# i had so much fun working on this project.
          It was a challenge suggested by a friend during 2019 quarantine to develop
          and release a game within one week...
          <br>
          Escape Circles reached Top 1 "most downloaded arcade game"
          for the 1<sup>st</sup> 24hr...

        <h2>KOUJINTY</h2>
        <p>Koujinty is one of the biggest projects that i wish it comes to life one day.
          Actually it's an app destined for our mums to help them in the kitchen.
          Through this app mums can create profiles (user name, birthday date, location...)
          fill their fridge then based on ingredients it suggest some recipes. Recipes can be submitted by you and other users.
          Based on your birthday date and other special dates this app will recommand u some special recipes. In addition
          "Koujinty" includes market section, where we suggest markets and stores next to you based on your location and also gives you the opportunity
          to see markets on the map and a lot of other features....
          <br>
          As you can see, this project is little bit bigger than what i can do so i need help.
          <br>All what i got so far is this app prototype "layouts made with adobe Illustrator to let you know how it's going to look like."
